# SLASHR - Front End

SLASHR is a web-based app that allows users to log their favorite horror films. The app uses the TMDB (the movie database) API to provide users with information about different horror movies, and allows them to search for specific movies and add them to their watchlist. With SLASHR, horror movie fans can easily keep track of the movies they've watched and discover new ones to add to their list.
